      <description>How to Play By clicking the left mouse button, you will summon the box at the mouse position.
Use the box and try to go further!
You will die easily.
When you summon the box you need to wait for the box is fully summoned.
Or you will crash to box and die.
I think I made this game too difficult to play. Maybe fix this later.
ETC This game was for https://itch.</description>

      <description>Preparations  You have to know very basic things in JS  Targets  Beginner  Time to read  10 - 15 mins  Source code  https://github.com/Dinwy/BlogCode  When I just get started to learn about JS, one of the biggest question was what is the event. How computer knows that I&amp;rsquo;m sending a event? Does computer checking for updates every single time? It was a stupid question but I think other people may ask the some question.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to open my new blog!
The main purpose of this blog is to help people just get started programming in JS or C#. I&amp;rsquo;ll write down very easy things in coding. What beginners need to know but usually not explained well or being skipped because which are regarded as basic. Also I&amp;rsquo;ll save some rough ideas somehow related with coding.
I hope you could get some knowledge from here.</description>
