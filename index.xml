      <description>Preparations  You have to know very basic things in JS  Targets  Beginner  Time to read  10 - 15 mins  Source code  https://github.com/Dinwy/BlogCode  When I just get started to learn about JS, one of the biggest question was what is the event. How computer knows that I&amp;rsquo;m sending a event? Does computer checking for updates every single time? It was a stupid question but I think other people may ask the some question.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to open my new blog!
The main purpose of this blog is to help people just get started programming in JS or C#. I&amp;rsquo;ll write down very easy things in coding. What beginners need to know but usually not explained well or being skipped because which are regarded as basic. Also I&amp;rsquo;ll save some rough ideas somehow related with coding.
I hope you could get some knowledge from here.</description>
