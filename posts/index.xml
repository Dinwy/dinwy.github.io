      <description>How to Play By clicking the left mouse button, you will summon the box at the mouse position.
Use the box and try to go further!
You will die easily.
When you summon the box you need to wait for the box is fully summoned.
Or you will crash to box and die.
I think I made this game too difficult to play. Maybe fix this later.
ETC This game was for https://itch.</description>

      <description>Preparations  You have to know very basic things in JS  Targets  Beginner  Time to read  10 - 15 mins  Source code  https://github.com/Dinwy/BlogCode  When I just get started to learn about JS, one of the biggest question was what is the event. How computer knows that I&amp;rsquo;m sending a event? Does computer checking for updates every single time? It was a stupid question but I think other people may ask the some question.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m really glad to open my new blog!
The main purpose of this blog is record my process and share my knowledge to people.
I hope you could get some fun from here. I&amp;rsquo;m worrying about one thing that my english writing skill. I&amp;rsquo;m not a native english speaker so I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I&amp;rsquo;ll make many silly mistakes. However I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to write it correctly.
Have fun!</description>
