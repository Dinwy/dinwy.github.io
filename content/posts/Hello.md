Hello, I'm really glad to open my new blog!

The main purpose of this blog is record my process and share my knowledge to people.

I hope you could get some fun from here. I'm worrying about one thing that my english writing skill. I'm not a native english speaker so I'm sure that I'll make many silly mistakes. However I'll try my best to write it correctly.

Have fun!
