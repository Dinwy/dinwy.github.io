Hello, I'm really glad to open my new blog!

The main purpose of this blog is to help people just get started programming in JS or C#. I'll write down very easy things in coding. What beginners need to know but usually not explained well or being skipped because which are regarded as basic. Also I'll save some rough ideas somehow related with coding.

I hope you could get some knowledge from here. One thing I'm worring about is my english writing skill. I'm not a native english user so that make hard to understand the context. But I'll try my best.

FYI, you can get more information about me in the ME page.

Have fun!
