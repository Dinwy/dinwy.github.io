# Description

Fighting + TCG Game. This is my second time in Ludum Dare! Well, I joined last winter ludumdare 40 but I failed :). Thefore now is the first time I’m actually publishing it! My goal was real fighting like as tekken + TCG. So both user concurrently execute the action and show the result.
How to play

TL; DR: Click the card when you are ready to play!

    Player & Computer both has 50 HP
    Damage of Punch is 10
    Damage of Low kick is 15
    When counter attack success, attacker will get doubled damage of their attack. For example, if Player attacked Enemy by punch and get counter attacked, player will get 20 damage.

The site I linked above is really good for prototyping.

## How I feel

I wish that I could spent more time on this game. Was too busy. Ah… I’m dying now. Haha. I spend too much time for nothing. I should’ve learn about how to prototype faster.
