## Summary

## Nomenclature
- Vector: Consist of direction and magnitude.
- Dot Product: Generate scalar value.
- Unit Vector: Create unit vector. Vector / Magnitude. u^=∣∣u∣∣ / u->
- Scalar Quantity: A quantity which does not depend on direction.
- Vector Quantity: A quantity which depends on direction.
