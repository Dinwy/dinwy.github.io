# Preface

I have found good articles about explaining about materials. Therefore it is a good time to clean that up.

## Summary

- World is only visible because they are reflecting light.
- Diffuse Reflection
    - The light is reflected from the surface at multiple different angles.
- Specular Reflection
    - The light that comes in and reflects out from the surface make the same angle.
- Conductors alter the color of the specular reflection, tinting them. While the Dielectrics materials will be neutral to the light and not affect the color of the specular reflection.
- In order to get a good non-metallic result (neutral specular color), we need to neutralize the specular reflection using the inverse color of the diffuse.

## Nomenclature

- 3D model: Geometric data for 3d computer graphics
- Material: Enhancement of texture mapping. Result of combination of shaders and textures. 
- Shaders: Tell the renderer how an object should be displayed.
- Textures: Provide visual information to the shader.
- Normal Maps: Information contains the light bounce of the surface.
- Alpha Maps: Define transparency.
- Dielectrics: Do not conduct electricity.
- Conductor: Conduct electricity.
