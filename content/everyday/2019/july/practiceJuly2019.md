# Description

Inspired by **CG Boost**'s (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWWybvw9jnpOdJq_6wTHryA/videos) `SCULPT JANUARY 2016`, I'd like to improve my skill.

## Rules

> Daily renders are to get better at your craft. Not for exposure. Not to make money.` (https://www.reddit.com/r/Cinema4D/comments/6sv932/daily_renders/)

- Spend around 1 hour for each goals

## Main Goals

- Daily Sculpt
- Daily Algorithm

Since I don't know much about sculpting I want to improve this area. Also about algorithm, I haven't solving algorithm problems for a while I want to review my code and re-practice how to solve a problem. **CS Dojo** channel(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A) looks good for this.

## Side Goals
 
- Daily Shader
- Daily Game Prototyping
- Daily Render

If I have some free time at work, I'd like to do things like daily shader in UE4 or Shadertoy. Also want to make a prototype of game in Unity3D very quickly.
