# Description

This weekend, I made a small game prototype for the future. <br/>
I always wanted to make a hexagon based board game. I'd have this idea since 2014 but lack of knowledge of programming I couldn't able to make it. However now I can do it without big problems. There are some problems which I need to solve but generally it is okay.<br/>
Current state of this game is more likely a architectural setup before building a real game.

## Small-Talk

I've spent a good time on writing code. Saturday was not really productive but Sunday was really good. I restrained myself well from playing games watching Netflix so else. Being creative was always a big obstacle to me. However I managed well this weekend and I'm so proud of myself. Hope I could build a good game from this start.
