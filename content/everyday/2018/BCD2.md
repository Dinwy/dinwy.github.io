# Description

Performance improvements and bug fixes. <br/>
Since game graphic has not been changed much it looks same as before. But game changed a bit more than what it looks like.

## Changes

- Split logic and UI properly (WIP)
- Putting tie logic (WIP)
- Enable GPU instancing
- Fix Render setting
- Camera adjustment and resize character

## Small-Talk

I've decided to do programming everyday but I was too lazy. However I'm glad I'm still working on it and it seems fine so far.<br/>
Hope I could do this everyday and finish it soon.
