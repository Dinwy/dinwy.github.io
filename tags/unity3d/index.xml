      <description>Description Performance improvements and bug fixes.  Since game graphic has not been changed much it looks same as before. But game changed a bit more than what it looks like.
Changes  Split logic and UI properly (WIP) Putting tie logic (WIP) Enable GPU instancing Fix Render setting Camera adjustment and resize character  Small-Talk I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do programming everyday but I was too lazy. However I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;m still working on it and it seems fine so far.</description>

      <description>Description This weekend, I made a small game prototype for the future.  I always wanted to make a hexagon based board game. I&amp;rsquo;d have this idea since 2014 but lack of knowledge of programming I couldn&amp;rsquo;t able to make it. However now I can do it without big problems. There are some problems which I need to solve but generally it is okay. Current state of this game is more likely a architectural setup before building a real game.</description>

      <description>How to Play By clicking the left mouse button, you will summon the box at the mouse position.
Use the box and try to go further!
You will die easily.
When you summon the box you need to wait for the box is fully summoned.
Or you will crash to box and die.
I think I made this game too difficult to play. Maybe fix this later.
ETC This game was for https://itch.</description>
