      <description>Preface Yesterday, I have solved algorithm quiz on LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/ After solving the problem, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that this quiz is related with DFS(depth-first-search). So it is good to know what is DFS.
Source From  Depth-first search: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search Recursion: https://www.dotnetperls.com/recursion  Summary  C# doesn&amp;rsquo;t support tail-recursion-optimization &amp;gt; Yes, the CLR supports .tail. The Roslyn compiler currently has no facility for inserting .tail at all, regardless of what the CLR currently does, however.</description>
