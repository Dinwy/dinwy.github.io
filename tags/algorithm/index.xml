      <description>Link https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
Summary This was asking same question as AddTwoNumbers. Can properly reference next in LinkedArray.  Still quite slow, but solving much faster than before.
Solutions My Solution I was a bit confused which order comes first outputTail.next or outputTail. But it is obvious. The proper steps will be,
 Assign a new value to the outputTail.next via new ListNode(x). Change the pointer(ref) of outputTail to outputTail.next which is a new value has been assigned.</description>

      <description>Preface I think I&amp;rsquo;ve already solved this problem on CodeWars. But it is a good exercise solve this problem again.
Link https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses
Summary This is asking two things, can you use Stack and Dictionary. When I was solving this first time, I was more thinking about using three HashSet. However after thinking and checking the best solution, I only need a single Dictionary &amp;amp; temporary Stack to validate.
Solution My First Solution public bool IsValidFirstSolution(string s) { var stack = new Stack&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(s.</description>

      <description>Preface I&amp;rsquo;m trying to take a Easy difficulty ones to warm up my coding practice.
Link https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/ https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/
Summary Solving these two problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard. Both are asking the same thing. Can you pop number from integer rather than using string  However re-learning that pop = x % 10 &amp;amp; x /= 10
Solution 7.ReverseInteger public class ReverseInteger { public int Solution(int x) { var str = x.ToString(); var leng = x &amp;lt; 0 ?</description>

      <description>Preface I&amp;rsquo;ve solved this problem a year ago with a weird way. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed this problem.
Link  https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers  Summary Reviewing this problem took more than an hour, which made me disappointed and surprise me.  I was very confused assigning outputTail. Same as
{ l1 = l1.next; l2 = l2.next; outputTail = outputTail.next; }  By assigning nextNode to the currentNode which will make loop end at some point.</description>

      <guid>https://dinwy.github.io/algorithm/2020/Rotating2DArray/</guid>
      <description>Preface It is a interesting question that how to solve this problem. It was really easy to solve this with temp array and copy the value with recursive function. However I was quite confused how to solve in-array When I was solving this problem I was quite confused how to move the element to the array.
My Solution # Recursive solution def rotate(given_array, n): rotated = copy.deepcopy(given_array) for pRow in range(n): for pCol in range(n): rotated[pCol][(n - 1) - pRow] = given_array[pRow][pCol] return given_array  # In-place solution def rotate(given_array, n): for y in range((int)(n / 2)): for x in range(math.</description>

      <description> https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string
Basically this question is asking you about how to you Dictionary. Understanding how to handle key and value and index, can solve this problem easily.
My Solution class Solution(object): def firstUniqChar(self, s): strDict = {} for item in s: if (item in strDict): strDict[item] += 1 else: strDict[item] = 1 for idx, key in enumerate(s): if strDict[key] == 1: return idx return -1  </description>

      <description>Description I supposed to solve this problem 3 days ago Count The Islands(https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-islands) but didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to make it happen. Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve solved this problem today.
 Difficulty Level: 6kyu  Count The Islands Details Summary
Implement an algorithm which analyzes an two-color image and determines how many isolated areas of a single color the image contains. Islands
An &amp;ldquo;island&amp;rdquo; is an set of adjacent pixels of one color which is completely surrounded by pixels of another color.</description>

      <guid>https://dinwy.github.io/study/2019/depthFirstSearch/</guid>
      <description>Preface Yesterday, I have solved algorithm quiz on LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/ After solving the problem, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that this quiz is related with DFS(depth-first-search). So it is good to know what is DFS.
Source From  Depth-first search: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search Recursion: https://www.dotnetperls.com/recursion  Summary  C# doesn&amp;rsquo;t support tail-recursion-optimization &amp;gt; Yes, the CLR supports .tail. The Roslyn compiler currently has no facility for inserting .tail at all, regardless of what the CLR currently does, however.</description>
