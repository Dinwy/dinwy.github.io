      <description>Description This weekend, I made a small game prototype for the future.  I always wanted to make a hexagon based board game. I&amp;rsquo;d have this idea since 2014 but lack of knowledge of programming I couldn&amp;rsquo;t able to make it. However now I can do it without big problems. There are some problems which I need to solve but generally it is okay. Current state of this game is more likely a architectural setup before building a real game.</description>
